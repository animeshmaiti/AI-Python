    " In Python, `re` stands for \"Regular Expressions.\" It is a built-in module that provides support for regular expressions. Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. The re module allows you to work with regular expressions in Python, enabling you to search for patterns within strings, replace text based on patterns, and more.\n",

    "1. `re.compile(pattern)`: Compiles a regular expression pattern into a regex object for efficient use in matching and searching.\n",
    "1. `re.search(pattern, string)`: Searches for the first occurrence of the pattern in the given string and returns a match object if found.\n",
    "1. `re.match(pattern, string)`: Matches the pattern only at the beginning of the string and returns a match object if it's a match.\n",
    "1. `re.findall(pattern, string)`: Returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string as a list of strings.\n",
    "1. `re.finditer(pattern, string)`: Returns an iterator yielding match objects for all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string.\n",

The Porter Stemmer is a popular algorithm for stemming words, which means it removes suffixes from words to convert them to their base form. For example, \"running\" becomes \"run,\" and \"jumps\" becomes \"jump.\" Stemming can be useful for text normalization in various NLP applications."
